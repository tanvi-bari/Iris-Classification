# Iris-Classification
Objective:
To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Tools Used:
1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Matplotlib
5.Seaborn
6.Scikit-learn
7.Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Used:
1.Imported and explored the Iris dataset.
2.Performed data preprocessing and checked for missing values.
3.Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
4.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5.Applied classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression / KNN / Decision Tree).
6.Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## Outcome:
Successfully developed a classification model with high accuracy in predicting iris species, demonstrating strong understanding of supervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
